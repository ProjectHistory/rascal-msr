* CVS - NetBeans Lib Cvs Client (dual GPL/CDDL, for which we choose CDDL)
* SVN - SvnKit - TMateSoft license (which is viral, like GPL)
* GIT - modified source code from edu.nyu.cs.javagit (LGPL)

The code that this package introduces is licensed EPL (Eclipse Public License).

!!!DISCLAIMER!!!

You should realize that the code you build on top of this library will have 
to be open-source. This is mainly due to the SvnKit license. Also, the NetBeans and 
JavaGit licenses may have such an effect, but this is less clear.
